[2025-12-02 11:06 UTC+5.5] Phase 7.4: Created database connection test API - Added test-connection API to diagnose environment variables and database connectivity, helps identify root cause of read-later API issues, committed changes (4990616) and deployed to Vercel
[2025-12-02 11:14 UTC+5.5] Phase 7.5: Fixed JWT authentication method in read-later API - Changed to use supabase.auth.setAuth() and getUser() on service role client, removed separate anon client, added detailed error logging, committed changes (fa1186d) and deployed to Vercel
[2025-12-02 11:22 UTC+5.5] Phase 7.6: Created alternative read-later API test using anon key with RLS - Created read-later-test.js API that uses anon key instead of service role, tests if issue is with service role vs RLS policies, committed changes (b6566b8) and deployed to Vercel
[2025-12-02 11:29 UTC+5.5] Phase 7.7: Fixed JWT verification by using separate anon and service clients - Use anon client for JWT verification and service role client for database operations, this hybrid approach should resolve authentication issues, committed changes (382adfa)
[2025-12-02 11:43 UTC+5.5] Phase 7.8: Clean up API files to stay under Vercel Hobby plan limit - Removed 5 test/debug API files (test-connection.js, setup-database.js, read-later-test.js, setup-db.js, test.js) to reduce function count from 13 to 8, committed changes (126a4f3) and deployed to Vercel - Should now deploy successfully within 12 function limit
[2025-12-02 13:24 UTC+5.5] Phase 8.6: Update read-later API to use user_read_later table - Changed table name from 'read_later' to 'user_read_later' in all API operations (GET, POST, DELETE), committed changes (f4e5266) and deployed to Vercel - API now uses correct table name
[2025-12-02 14:26 UTC+5.5] Phase 8.5: Fix frontend read-later API calls to use correct endpoint and JWT authentication - Updated handleReadLaterClick function to use proper JWT token authentication, changed API endpoint from '/api/user-preferences/add/' to '/api/user/read-later', fixed POST request body to match API expectations, added proper error handling and user feedback, made function async to support session token, committed changes (db2d791) and deployed to Vercel - Frontend now calls correct API with proper authentication
[2025-12-02 14:35 UTC+5.5] Phase 8.7: Fix frontend authentication checks to use correct Supabase user properties - Changed authentication check from currentUser.user_id to currentUser.id (Supabase users have 'id' property), set localStorage 'user_logged_in' flag when user logs in successfully, clear localStorage flag when user logs out, fixed authentication state detection for read-later functionality, committed changes (59447ae) and deployed to Vercel - Authentication state now properly detected
[2025-12-02 14:43 UTC+5.5] Phase 8.8: Fix frontend fetch promise chain scope issue - Fixed 'response is not defined' error in handleReadLaterClick, changed fetch promise chain to properly pass response status between .then() callbacks, store response.ok status in first .then() and pass it to data callback, this ensures response status is accessible when processing API response data, committed changes (9c24acd) and deployed to Vercel - Frontend JavaScript errors resolved
[2025-12-02 14:52 UTC+5.5] Phase 8.9: Fix UUID to INTEGER conversion for user_id in read-later API - Added UUID to INTEGER conversion for user_id column in all operations, convert Supabase UUID to consistent INTEGER using hex parsing, userIdInt = parseInt(user.id.replace(/-/g, '').substring(0, 8), 16), this maps UUID strings to INTEGER values for database compatibility, applied to GET, POST, DELETE operations in read-later API, committed changes (26d9cab) and deployed to Vercel - Should resolve 500 database errors
[2025-12-02 14:59 UTC+5.5] Phase 8.10: Implement cleaner UUID approach for user_id column - Following user suggestion, altered user_read_later table schema to change user_id from INTEGER to UUID type for better database design, removed all UUID to INTEGER conversion logic from API code, updated all database operations to use user.id directly, cleaner and more maintainable code that properly matches Supabase auth system, committed changes (4623ae1) and deployed to Vercel - Perfect database design with native UUID support
